# Setting Up GSAP

GSAP can be installed as an npm package or placed directed in the project. This README will tell you how to install GSAP through npm. The packages you will need to have installed are parcel-bundler, sass, and, of course, GSAP. Before getting into GSAP, set up your project as if it were a normal project with just parcel-bundler. Once that's set up, make sure your js and scss are linked to your html file. Once they're linked, you need to import GSAP into your js file with <br> <br>

`import { gsap } from "gsap";` <br> <br>

Once GSAP is imported into your js file, you should be ready to start!

## GSAP Plugins

GSAP plugins can be accessed by downloading the GSAP zip file (found on the GSAP documentation installation page) when you are signed into an account. You can then bring the gsap-bonus.tgz file into your project's folder in order to install it with npm using npm i ./gsap-bonus.tgz. It is important to note that some plugins are for Club GreenSock members only, these plugins being: <br>
