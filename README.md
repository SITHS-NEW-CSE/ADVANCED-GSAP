# What Is The Timeline?

The timeline is the main way to seqeuence your animations in GSAP. A timeline will hold tweens and even other timelines, making a simple way to set the time each element will begin its animation. By default a timeline will have all animations play immediately after each other, but the timing can be changed quite simply.
